        <h1 id="the-goal-e-coli-c-1-assembly">The goal: <em>E. coli</em> C-1 assembly</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we assemble and annotate genome of <em>E. coli</em> strain <a href="http://cgsc2.biology.yale.edu/Strain.php?ID=8232">C-1</a>. This strain is routinely used in experimental evolution studies involving bacteriophages. For instance, now classical works by Holly Wichman and Jim Bull (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409816">Bull et al. 1997</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9767038">Bull &amp; Wichman 1998</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10411508">Wichman et al. 1999</a>) have been performed using this strain and bacteriophage phiX174.</p>

<p>To sequence the genome we have obtained the strain from the <a href="http://cgsc2.biology.yale.edu/">Yale E. coli Stock Center</a>. The stock center sent us a filter paper disk infused with cells. The disk was placed in the center of an LB-agar plate. A single colony was picked and resuspended in a liquid LB medium, grown overnight, and genomic DNA was isolated. The DNA was then sequenced using two methods. To obtain high coverage, high accuracy data we used Illumina miSEQ to generated 250-bp paired end reads. To generate high length reads we used the Oxford Nanopore MinIon machine.</p>

<p>Our goal is to reconstruct and annotate the full genome of <em>E. coli</em> C-1. As you will see in this tutorial a combination of many short, high accuracy reads with long, error-prone reads helps us produce an almost perfect assembly.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we assemble genome using two types of input data: (1) Illumina 250 bp paired-end reads and (2) Oxford Nanopore reads.</p>

<h3 id="illumina-data">Illumina data</h3>

<p>We generated 9,345,897 250 bp read pairs (library preparation performed on genomic DNA fragmented to mean size of 600 bp). However, to make sure that you can complete this tutorial in a finite amount of time we have downsampled (reduced in size) this to 1,000,000 paired end reads - just enough to produce an accurate assembly.</p>

<h3 id="oxford-nanopore-data">Oxford Nanopore Data</h3>

<p>There are 12,738 <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n4/fig_tab/nmeth.3290_SF13.html">2d-reads</a>. Maximum read length is 27,518. The distribution of reads lengths looks like this:</p>

<figure id="figure-1"><img src="../../images/ont_length.png" alt="Nanopore read length distribution" title="Distribution of nanopore read lengths." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 1:</span> Distribution of nanopore read lengths.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can see that there many reads under the second peak with median of approximately 7.5 kb.</p>

<p>For assembly we will be using <a href="https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler">Unicycler</a> (also see publication by Wick:<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005595">2017</a>). Unicycler is designed specifically for <em>hybrid assembly</em> (the one combines short and long read sequencing data) of small (e.g., bacterial, viral, organellar) genomes. In our hands it has produced complete high quality assemblies. Unicycler employs a multi-step process that utilizes a number of software tools:</p>

<figure id="figure-2"><img src="../../images/unicycler.png" alt="Unicycler process" title="Simplified view of the Unicycler assembly process (From Wick:2017). In short, Unicycler uses SPAdes (see below) to produce an assembly graph, which is then bridged (simplified) using long reads to produce longest possible set of contigs. These are then polished by aligning original short reads against produced contigs and feeding these alignment to Pilon - an assembly improvement tool." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 2:</span> Simplified view of the Unicycler assembly process (From Wick:2017).

These are then polished by aligning original short reads against produced contigs and feeding these alignment to Pilon - an assembly improvement tool.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As you can see Unicycler relies heavily on <a href="http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/">SPAdes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/wiki">Pilon</a>. We will briefly describe these two tools.</p>

<h4 id="spades">Spades</h4>

<h5 id="multisized-debruijn-graph">Multisized deBruijn graph</h5>

<p>Assemblers usually constructing graphs for <em>k</em>-mers of a fixed size. We have noted that when <em>k</em> is small it is difficult to resolve the repeats. If <em>k</em> is too large a corresponding graph may become fragments (especially if read coverage is low). SPAdes uses several values for <em>k</em> (that are either manually set or inferred automatically) to create a <em>multisized</em> graph that minimized tangledness and fragmentation by combining various <em>k</em>-mers (see <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cmb.2012.0021">Bankevich:2012</a>):</p>

<figure id="figure-3"><img src="../../images/multiGraph.jpg" alt="Multigraph approach implemented in SPAdes" title="Multisized de Bruijn graph. A circular Genome CATCAGATAGGA is covered by a set Reads consisting of nine 4-mers, {ACAT, CATC, ATCA, TCAG, CAGA, AGAT, GATA, TAGG, GGAC}. Three out of 12 possible 4-mers from Genome are missing from Reads (namely {ATAG,AGGA,GACA}), but all 3-mers from Genome are present in Reads. (A) The outside circle shows a separate black edge for each 3-mer from Reads. Dotted red lines indicate vertices that will be glued. The inner circle shows the result of applying some of the glues.

<h5 id="read-pair-utilization">Read pair utilization</h5>

<p>While the use of paired reads and mate pairs is not new (and key) to genome assembly, SPAdes utilizes so called paired DeBruin graphs to take the advantage of the paired end data. One of the key issues with paired DeBruin graphs is the resulting genome assemblies do not tolerate variability in insert sizes (the initial formulation of paired DeBruijn graphs assumed constant distance between pairs of reads). In practice this distance is always variable. SPAdes performs <em>k</em>-bimer (these are <em>k</em>-mers derived from <em>paired</em> reads) adjustment to identify exact of nearly-exact distances for each <em>k</em>-bimer pair.</p>

<h5 id="error-correction">Error correction</h5>

<p>Sequencing data contains a substantial number of sequencing errors that manifest themselves as deviations (bulges and non-connected components) within the assembly graph. One of the ways to improve the graph even constructing it is to minimize the amount sequencing errors by performing error correction. SPAdes uses <a href="https://goo.gl/1iGkMe">BayesHammer</a> to correct the reads. Here is a brief summary of what it does (see <a href="https://goo.gl/1iGkMe">Nikolenko:2013</a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>SPAdes (or rather BayesHammer) counts <em>k</em>-mers in reads and computed <em>k</em>-mer statistics that takes into account base quality values.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_graph">Hamming graph</a> is constructed for <em>k</em>-mers is which <em>k</em>-mers are nodes. In this graph edges connect nodes (<em>k</em>-mers) is they differ from each other by a number of nucleotides up to a certain threshold (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a>). The graph is central to the error correction algorithm.</li>
  <li>At this step Bayesian subclustering of the graph produced in the previous step. For each <em>k</em>-mer we now know the center of its subcluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Solid</strong> <em>k</em>-mers are derived from cluster centers and are assumed to be <em>error free</em>.</li>
  <li>Solid <em>k</em>-mers are mapped back to the reads.</li>
  <li>Reads are corrected using solid <em>k</em>-mers:</li>
</ol>

<figure id="figure-4"><img src="../../images/readCorrection.jpg" alt="Read correction with BayesHammer" title="Read correction. Black &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mers are solid. Grey &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mers are non-solid. Red &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mers are the centers of the corresponding clusters (two grey &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mers striked through on the right are non-solid singletons). As a result, one nucleotide is changed based on majority rule. (From [Nikolenko:2013])" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 4:</span> Read correction. Black <em>k</em>-mers are solid. Grey <em>k</em>-mers are non-solid. Red <em>k</em>-mers are the centers of the corresponding clusters (two grey <em>k</em>-mers striked through on the right are non-solid singletons). As a result, one nucleotide is changed based on majority rule. (From [Nikolenko:2013])</figcaption></figure>

<p>In the case of the full dataset SPAdes error correction changed 14,013,757 bases in 3,382,337 reads - a substantial fraction of the full ~18 million read dataset.</p>

<h4 id="pilon">Pilon</h4>

<p>Pilon improves draft assemblies by using the information from the original reads aligned to the draft assembly. The following image from a publication by <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112963">Walker:2014</a> highlights the steps of this process:</p>

During the first step (top row), Pilon scans the read alignments for evidence where the sequencing data disagree with the input genome and makes corrections to small errors and detects small variants. During the second step (second row), Pilon looks for coverage and alignment discrepancies to identify potential mis-assemblies and larger variants. Finally (bottom row), Pilon uses reads and mate pairs which are anchored to the flanks of discrepant regions and gaps in the input genome to reassemble the area, attempting to fill in the true sequence including large insertions. The resulting output is an improved assembly and/or a VCF file of variants. (From Walker:2014)" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 5:</span> The left column depicts the conceptual steps of the Pilon process, and the center and right columns describe what Pilon does at each step while in assembly improvement and variant detection modes, respectively.

<h3 id="annotation">Annotation</h3>

<p>For annotation we are using <a href="http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/software.prokka.shtml">Prokka</a> (also see <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153">Seeman:2014</a>). It scans the assembly generated with Unicycler with a set of feature prediction tools and compiles a list of genome annotation. It predicts the following features (Table from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153">Seeman:2014</a>):</p>

<p>Prokka predicts protein-coding regions using a two step process. It first identifies coordinates of putative genes using <a href="https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal">Prodigal</a> and then compares the gene sequence against databases of known sequences at protein level using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/">Blast+</a> and <a href="http://hmmer.org/">HMMer</a>.</p>

<p>One can see that there are two (!) contigs. The largest contig is 4,576,290 bp (for comparison <em>E. coli</em> K12 MG1655 strain genome length is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_APIN00000000.1">4,656,144 bp</a>) and the smallest is 4,581,676 (total length) - 4,576,290 (length of the largest) = 5,386 bp. When we analyzed this dataset for the first time we were initially puzzled by this second contig. But we quickly realized that this is simply the genome of bacteriophage <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001422.1">phiX174</a> which is routinely used as a spike-in in Illumina sequencing.

<h2 id="visualize-the-results-in-igv">Visualize the results in IGV</h2>

<p>Let’s look at the entire assembly and its annotation in the genome browser. We can do this using Integrated Genome Browser (<a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">IGV</a>).</p>

<p>Visualization requires a local installation of IGV. If you have IGV installed - just start it. If you don’t - read on.</p>

<h4 id="starting-igv">Starting IGV</h4>

<p>Go to IGV <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download">download page</a> and select one of the options. The one I would try first would be <strong>Jave Web Start</strong>.Simply click the <strong>Launch</strong> button for 10 GB distribution.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Start IGV, it will look something like this:</p>

      <figure id="figure-13"><img src="../../images/igv1.png" alt="IGV just started" title="IGV started by using Java Web Start. Note that it is currently showing Human Genome (hg38) build. This is obviously &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; what we want." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 13:</span> IGV started by using Java Web Start. Note that it is currently showing Human Genome (hg38) build. This is obviously <b>not</b> what we want.</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Locate the output of Unicycler and expand it :</p>

      <figure id="figure-14"><img src="../../images/unicycler_igv.png" alt="Unicycler result Visualization" title="Expanding Unicycler assembly reveals IGV link." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 14:</span> Expanding Unicycler assembly reveals IGV link.</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click on the <em>local</em> link highlighted with orange outline. The browser will change:</p>

      <figure id="figure-15"><img src="../../images/igv2.png" alt="IGV with Unicycler assembly" title="Now you can see the major contig shown in the browser window." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 15:</span> Now you can see the major contig shown in the browser window.</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Let’s add Prokka annotations to the browser image. For this simply expand Prokka’s GFF3 dataset and click on the <em>local</em> link:</p>

      <figure id="figure-16"><img src="../../images/prokka_item.png" alt="Expanded GFF3 dataset representing Prokka annotations" title="Expanded GFF dataset generated with Prokka. Click on the &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; link (highlighted with orange outline) to display this dataset within IGV." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 16:</span> Expanded GFF dataset generated with Prokka. Click on the <em>local</em> link (highlighted with orange outline) to display this dataset within IGV.</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>You will now see the annotations within the browser window:</p>

<figure id="figure-17"><img src="../../images/igv3.png" alt="Prokka result Visualization" title="Viewing annotated assembly withing IGV." /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 17:</span> Viewing annotated assembly withing IGV.</figcaption></figure>
