Genome assembly is a difficult task. In trying to explain it we will be relying on two highly regarded sources:

- [Ben Langmead's Teaching Materials](http://www.langmead-lab.org/teaching-materials/)
- [Pevzner and Compeau Bioinformatics Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22033056-bioinformatics-algorithms).

# **Genomes and reads: Strings and *k*-mers**

]


## *k*-mer composition

Genomes are strings of text. When we sequence genomes we use sequencing machines that generate reads. For now let's assume that all reads have the same length *k* and every *k*-mer is sequenced only once. We will relax these assumptions later in this lecture. Thus sequencing a genome generates a large list of *k*-mers.

Suppose we are dealing with a *very* short genome `TATGGGGTGC`. Its *k*-mer composition (note the subscript) **Composition_k(Text)** is the collection of all *k*-mer substrings (including repeated ones). When *k* = 3 we get (basically we split sequence into windows of length 3 sliding window by 1 base every time):

<<<<<<< HEAD
<samp>
Composition_3(TATGGGGTGC)= ATG,GGG,GGG,GGT,GTG,TAT,TGC,TGG
<samp>
=======
&lt;samp&gt;
Composition_3(TATGGGGTGC)= ATG,GGG,GGG,GGT,GTG,TAT,TGC,TGG
&lt;samp&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906


---


<<<<<<< HEAD
<samp>
Composition_3(TATGGGGTGC)= ATG,GGG,GGG,GGT,GTG,TAT,TGC,TGG
<samp>

Note that we have listed *k*-mers in lexicographic order (i.e., how they would appear in a dictionary) rather than in the order of their appearance in <code>TATGGGGTGC</code>. We have done this because the correct ordering of the reads is unknown when they are generated (i.e., a sequencing machine does not generate reads in any particular order).

---

## Assembly by overlap

In the example above we know what the "genome" sequence is. In real life we don't know that and our goal is to determine genome sequence given a scrambled collection of *k*-mers. Let's consider the following collection of 3-mers representing a hypothetical genome:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<code> AAT ATG GTT TAA TGT </code>
=======
&lt;code&gt; AAT ATG GTT TAA TGT &lt;/code&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

Let's "tile" k-mers if they overlap in k-1 nucleotides:

```
TAA
 AAT
  ATG
   TGT
    GTT
-------
TAATGTT
```

---

Now let's apply it to slightly longer "genome" with the following 3-mer composition sorted in a lexicographic order:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<code>
AAT ATG ATG ATG CAT CCA GAT GCC GGA GGG GTT TAA TGC TGG TGT
</code>
=======
&lt;code&gt;
AAT ATG ATG ATG CAT CCA GAT GCC GGA GGG GTT TAA TGC TGG TGT
&lt;/code&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

`TAA` looks like a great beginning and we are continuing:
```
1 TAA
2  AAT
3   ATG
4    TGT
5     GTT
  -------
  TAATGTT
```

There is nothing in the original 3-mer composition, which starts with `TT`.

---

Let's track back and instead of `TGT` in step 4 insert `TGC`:

```
 1 TAA
 2  AAT
 3   ATG
 4    TGC
 5     GCC
 6      CCA
 7       CAT
 8        ATG
 9         TGG
10          GGA
11           GAT
12            ATG
13             TGT
14              GTT
   ----------------
   TAATGCCATGGATGTT
```

We only used 14 3-mers from the total of 15, so our genome is shorter (we have extra parts!). This difficulty is related to the fact that there are three repeated `ATG` motifs in this genome and as a result each `ATG` can be extended by either `TGG`, `TGC`, or `TGT`.

---

## The concept of coverage

*Coverage* is the number of reads covering a particular position in the genome. For example, in the following case:

```
TAA
 AAT
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ATG     <- "reads" (15 bases total)
   TGT
    GTT
-------
TAATGTT   <- "genome" (7 bases)
-------
0123456
```
The *Coverage* at positions 1 and 6 is *1*, at positions 1 and 5 is *2*, and at position 2, 3, and 4 is *3*. <br>The *Average Coverage* will be 15/7 ~ 2x
=======
  ATG     &lt;- "reads" (15 bases total)
   TGT
    GTT
-------
TAATGTT   &lt;- "genome" (7 bases)
-------
0123456
```
The *Coverage* at positions 1 and 6 is *1*, at positions 1 and 5 is *2*, and at position 2, 3, and 4 is *3*. &lt;br&gt;The *Average Coverage* will be 15/7 ~ 2x
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906


---

Below is another, slightly more realistic example where average coverage is 177/35 ~ 7x:

```
                  CTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
                CTCTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
              GGCTCTAGGCCCTCATTTTTT
           CTCGGCTCTAGCCCCTCATTTT
<<<<<<< HEAD
        TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         <- 177 bases
=======
        TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         &lt;- 177 bases
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

# The First and the Second laws of assembly

The goal of assembly process is to reconstruct an unknown genome sequence given a collection of scrambled sequencing reads:

```
CTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
CTCTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
GGCTCTAGGCCCTCATTTTTT
CTCGGCTCTAGCCCCTCATTTT
<<<<<<< HEAD
TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA                 <- Reads (Given)
=======
TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA                 &lt;- Reads (Given)
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

```

=======
???????????????????????????????????   &lt;- Genome (Unknown)
```
&gt;    **The goal of assembly process**. Given sequencing reads reconstruct underlying genome sequence.
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

 We've seen that this can (in principle) be accomplished by finding overlaps. We also discussed the concept of the coverage.  We can now formulate the two first assembly laws.

---

## The First Assembly Law: Overlaps imply co-location

<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's define terms **Prefix** and **Suffix** using string <code>TAA</code> as an example:

 * <code>Prefix(TAA) = TA</code>
 * <code>Suffix(TAA) = AA</code>
=======
Let's define terms **Prefix** and **Suffix** using string &lt;code&gt;TAA&lt;/code&gt; as an example:

 * &lt;code&gt;Prefix(TAA) = TA&lt;/code&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;Suffix(TAA) = AA&lt;/code&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

The First law states that if a *suffix* of one read is similar to a *prefix* of another read...

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG    <- read 1
    ||||||| |||||||
    TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC  <- read 2
=======
TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG    &lt;- read 1
    ||||||| |||||||
    TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC  &lt;- read 2
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906
```

...then they may overlap (may be derived from the same location) within the genome.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
      TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG                  <- read 1
 -------------------------------------
 AGCGTTCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGGCCGTGCAGGACGT     <- genome
 -------------------------------------
          TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC                <- read 2
=======
      TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG                  &lt;- read 1
 -------------------------------------
 AGCGTTCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGGCCGTGCAGGACGT     &lt;- genome
 -------------------------------------
          TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC                &lt;- read 2
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906
```

---

Note that in the above example suffix of the first read is *not* exactly identical to the prefix of the second read: they differ by a G-to-A substitution. Such differences are quite common in real life and may be caused by:

* **sequencing errors** - experimental or computational artifacts of DNA sequencing procedures.
* **allelic differences** - organisms such as human are diploid (and others, such as wheat are hexaploid) which maternal and paternal genomes being different at a number of genomic sites.
* **polymorphic sites** - DNA that is being sequenced is usually isolated from a large number of cells (e.g., white blood cells) or individuals (bacterial and viral cultures). Natural variation present in these cell (or viral particle) populations will manifest itself as these differences.

---

## The Second Assembly Law: The higher the coverage, the better

The Second law states that higher coverage leads to more frequent and longer overlaps:

```
                   CTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
<<<<<<< HEAD
         TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         <- Low coverage
 GGCGTCTATATCT
 -----------------------------------
 GGCGTCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGGCCCTCATTTTTT   <- Genome
=======
         TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         &lt;- Low coverage
 GGCGTCTATATCT
 -----------------------------------
 GGCGTCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGGCCCTCATTTTTT   &lt;- Genome
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906
 -----------------------------------
                   CTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
                 CTCTAGGCCCTCAATTTTT
               GGCTCTAGGCCCTCATTTTTT
            CTCGGCTCTAGCCCCTCATTTT
<<<<<<< HEAD
         TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         <- Higher coverage
=======
         TATCTCGACTCTAGGCCCTCA         &lt;- Higher coverage
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906
         TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC
     TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG
 GGCGTCTATATCTCG
 GGCGTCGATATCT
 GGCGTCTATATCT
```

# Solving assembly problem with graphs

We can solve assembly challenge using overlaps between sequencing reads. However, to solve this problem effectively we need to first represent all overlaps in a way that would facilitate further analysis. *Directed graphs* help achieving this.

---

## Directed graphs

Finding overlaps is identical to building a *directed graph* where directed *edges* connect *nodes* representing overlapping reads:
![](../../images/dag.png)

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

For example, the string reconstruction we have seen earlier (with the difference of inserting `GGG` in line 10):

```
 1 TAA
 2  AAT
 3   ATG
 4    TGC
 5     GCC
 6      CCA
 7       CAT
 8        ATG
 9         TGG
10          GGG
11           GGA
12            GAT
13             ATG
14              TGT
15               GTT
   -----------------
   TAATGCCATGGGATGTT
```

can be represented as a following directed graph (or genome path):

![](../../images/4.6.png)

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Genome path**. Trimers composing the <code>TAATGCCATGGGATGTT</code> sequence represented as the "genome" path. (Fig. 4.6 from [CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)). In this path a suffix of a 3-mer is equal to prefix of the next 3-mer.
=======

>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---



**However**, we do not know the actual genome! All we have in real life is a collection of reads. Let's first build an overlap graph by connecting two 3-mers if suffix of one is equal to the prefix of the other:


<<<<<<< HEAD
>![](../../images/4.7.png)
>
>**Overlap graph**. All possible overlap connections for our 3-mer collection. (Fig. 4.7 from [CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/))
=======
&gt;![](../../images/4.7.png)
&gt;
&gt;**Overlap graph**. All possible overlap connections for our 3-mer collection. (Fig. 4.7 from [CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/))
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

So to determine the sequence of the underlying genome we are looking a path in this graph that visits every node (3-mer) once. Such path is called [Hamiltonial path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) and it may not be unique.

---

For example for our 3-mer collection there two possible Hamiltonian paths:

![](../../images/4.9a.png)
![](../../images/4.9b.png)

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Two Hamiltonian paths for the 15 3-mers**. Edges spelling "genomes" <code>TAATGCCATGGGATGTT</code> and <code>TAATGGGATGCCATGTT</code> are highlighted in black. (Fig. 4.9. from [[CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)).

---

The reason for this "duality" is the fact that we have a *repeat*: 3-mer <code>ATG</code> is present three times in our data (<font color="green">green</font>, <font color="red">red</font>, and <font color="blue">blue</font>). As we will see later repeats cause a lot of trouble in genome assembly.

## Finding overlaps

In the example above we had a collection of 3-mers and were always looking for overlaps of length two. In real life things may not be so "regular". Suppose we have two reads:

```
Read X CTCTAGGCC
Read Y TAGGCCCTC
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
What is the overlap between these two reads? For now we will define overlap of <code>length - l</code> suffix of Read X matches <code>length - l</code> prefix of Read Y, where <code>l</code> is given. To find these overlap we look in Read Y for instances <code>length - l</code> suffix of Read X.
=======
What is the overlap between these two reads? For now we will define overlap of &lt;code&gt;length - l&lt;/code&gt; suffix of Read X matches &lt;code&gt;length - l&lt;/code&gt; prefix of Read Y, where &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; is given. To find these overlap we look in Read Y for instances &lt;code&gt;length - l&lt;/code&gt; suffix of Read X.
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

We will start with some minimal match of length $k$. Once a match is found it will be extended to the left to verify that the entire prefix of Read Y matches:

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

As a result we represent two reads are connected nodes:
<<<<<<< HEAD
>
>![](../../images/og1.png)

>Number above the edge shows the length of the overlap.

While with just two reads the problem may seen quite straightforward. Let now consider a set of reads representing a very short genome <code>GTACGTACGAT</code>:

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Building an overlap graph with overlap of <code>length >= 4</code> will give us the following:

Building an overlap graph with overlap of &lt;code&gt;length &gt;= 4&lt;/code&gt; will give us the following:

## The Shortest Common Superstring Problem

The problem of reconstructing genome using the overlap graph that we have just illustrated can be initially formulated as the *Shortest Common Superstring (SCS)* problem. It states: *given a collection of strings S, find SCS(S), which is the shortest string that contains all strings from the set S as substrings*.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For simplicity let's suppose that we have the following set of strings <code>S</code>:

<samp>
BAA AAB BBA ABA ABB BBB AAA BAB
</samp>

One way of getting a string that would contain all of these as substrings will simply be concatenating them:

<samp>
Concat(S): BAAAABBBAABAABBBBBAAABAB (length = 24)
</samp>
=======
For simplicity let's suppose that we have the following set of strings &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;samp&gt;
BAA AAB BBA ABA ABB BBB AAA BAB
&lt;/samp&gt;

One way of getting a string that would contain all of these as substrings will simply be concatenating them:

&lt;samp&gt;
Concat(S): BAAAABBBAABAABBBBBAAABAB (length = 24)
&lt;/samp&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906


This, however, is not the *shortest* superstring that contains all strings from $S$. Instead the SCS is (just trust us here):

<<<<<<< HEAD
<samp>
SCS(S):: AAABBBABAA (length = 10)
</samp>
=======
&lt;samp&gt;
SCS(S):: AAABBBABAA (length = 10)
&lt;/samp&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906



---

It looks like finding SCS for a set of sequencing reads may just be what we need to produce a genome assembly. But how can this work in practice? One potential idea is to order the strings in some way and "reduce" them into a superstring (following examples are from Ben Langmead):

Ultimately we need to try all possible ordering and pick the shortest among all. Using this approach is we have <code>S</code> strings we will need to do <code>S!</code> tries. This can quickly get impossible. For our set of
eight strings <code>8! = 40320</code>. If we get, say, a 1,000,000 reads from an Illumina machine then the factorial of a million is not going to be an attractive analysis option.

&gt;![](../../images/scs1.png)

&gt;Let's look at the first two strings. They can be "reduced" to `AAAB`:
&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/scs2.png)
&gt;
&gt;The next two add an `A`:
&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/scs3.png)
&gt;
&gt;Third and fourth add `BB`:
&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/scs4.png)

---

&gt;Continuing this we will eventually get `AAABABBAABABBABB`:
&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/scs5.png)
&gt;
&gt;But `AAABABBAABABBABB` is the shortest only for this particular ordering. So let's reorder and try again:
&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/scs6.png)
&gt;
&gt;Now we did better, but maybe we can do even better.

Ultimately we need to try all possible ordering and pick the shortest among all. Using this approach is we have &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; strings we will need to do &lt;code&gt;S!&lt;/code&gt; tries. This can quickly get impossible. For our set of
eight strings &lt;code&gt;8! = 40320&lt;/code&gt;. If we get, say, a 1,000,000 reads from an Illumina machine then the factorial of a million is not going to be an attractive analysis option.

## Shortest common superstring: Greedy approach

As we've seen it will be impossible to assemble the genome using SCS logic. There is a simplification called *Greedy* approach to SCS problem. Let's take the following set of "reads":

<<<<<<< HEAD
<samp>
AAA AAB ABB BBA BBB
</samp>

and first build an overlap graph:

>![](../../images/greedy1.png)
>
>**An overlap graph** for set <code>S: AAA AAB ABB BBA BBB</code>.
=======
&lt;samp&gt;
AAA AAB ABB BBA BBB
&lt;/samp&gt;

and first build an overlap graph:

&gt;![](../../images/greedy1.png)
&gt;
&gt;**An overlap graph** for set &lt;code&gt;S: AAA AAB ABB BBA BBB&lt;/code&gt;.
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

Next, we start collapsing the nodes to maximize the overlap (and hence to decrease the length of the SCS we are trying to construct):

<<<<<<< HEAD
>In the graph below there are multiple ties: nodes with outgoing edges of identical weights (e.g., edges pointing from `ABB` to both `BBA` and `BBB` have weight of two. Remember, that the weight is the length of overlap between two nodes' labels). In this situation we will break ties by randomly picking an edge to traverse. Let's pick <font color="red">`AAA` &#8594; `AAB`</font>:

&gt;
&gt;![](../../images/greedy9.png)
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

The above procedure can be computed *very* quickly. But there is a catch: it does not guarantee that it will give us truly the shortest superstring. It really depends on how we choose edges.

And the SCS of these two will be a concatenation `AAABBABBB` of length 9. Thus a greedy approach may produce different answers. However, it is a sufficient approximation as the superstring yielded this way will not be more than ~2.5 times longer than the true SCS ([Gusfield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145058.Algorithms_on_Strings_Trees_and_Sequences) 16.17.1).

# The Third Law of Assembly: Repeats are Evil!

Let's again apply Greedy SCS to a different "genome". Suppose we want to reconstruct the phrase:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<samp>
a_long_long_long_time
</samp>
=======
&lt;samp&gt;
a_long_long_long_time
&lt;/samp&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

from all 6-mers that overlap by at least 3 characters. The list of 6-mers is:

```
ng_lon      _long_      a_long      long_l      ong_ti      ong_lo      long_t
g_long      g_time      ng_tim
```

---

An overlap graph will look like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
>![](../../images/long.png)
>
<small>**An overlap graph** for with overlap length <code> >= 3<code>.</small>
=======
&gt;![](../../images/long.png)
&gt;
&lt;small&gt;**An overlap graph** for with overlap length &lt;code&gt; &gt;= 3&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

If we proceed with Greedy SCS we will follow the following trajectory through the graph:

<<<<<<< HEAD
>![](../../images/long_opt.png)
=======
&gt;![](../../images/long_opt.png)
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

To make things even clearer let's isolate the path:

![](../../images/long_opt_focus.png)

---

The total overlap here (the sum of edge weights) is 4+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5=44 but it gives us `a_long_long_time` as the shortest superstring:


```
a_long
  long_l
   ong_lo
    ng_lon
     g_long
      _long_
       long_t
        ong_ti
         ng_tim
          g_time
----------------
a_long_long_time
```

---

We are missing one instance of 'long' in this string. The following graph shows the path that would return the *correct* string:

<<<<<<< HEAD
 >![](../../images/long_corr.png)
=======
 &gt;![](../../images/long_corr.png)
>>>>>>> f1b01b7ef32ec4f29a7f797f014dae1d28ea2906

---

A path yielding the correct string with three repeats. The total overlap here is 5+3+3+5+4+4+5+5+5=39, which is *worse* than the previous path if our goal is to find the shortest superstring:

```
a_long
 _long_
    ng_lon
       long_l
        ong_lo
          g_long
            long_t
             ong_ti
              ng_tim
               g_time
---------------------
a_long_long_long_time
```

---


## Are we really looking for the shortest superstring?

As we've seen above the shortest common superstring (SCS) is:

1. **Difficult to obtain** as Greedy SCS algorithm does not guarantee finding it. So the answer we get may be longer thans the real genome we are trying to assemble.

2. **May be shorter than we want** because if the genome contains repeats that are longer than the reads we are using, Greedy SCS will collapse them and make assembly shorter that the genome we are trying to get.

Let's talk about an alternative way to represent the relationship between *k*-mers that may give us a more efficient algorithm.

# de Bruijn graphs

[Nicolaas de Bruijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn) had a purely theoretical interest of constructing _k_-universal strings for an arbitrary value of _k_. A _k_-universal string contains every possible _k_-mer only once:

<<<<<<< HEAD

>
>**de Bruijn graph**. From [Compeau:2011](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n11/abs/nbt.2023.html)

---

This problem is equivalent to a string reconstruction problem we have been talking about above: finding a _k_-universal string is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian path in an overlap graph constructed from all _k_-mers. Yet finding a Hamiltonian path in a really large graph (representing a real genome) is not a tractable problem as we have seen. Instead de Bruijn decided to represent _k_-mer composition in a graph using a slightly different logic. Again, suppose we have a "genome" <ode>TAATGCCATGGGATGTT</code> split in a collection of 3-mers:

TAA AAT ATG TGC GCC CCA CAT ATG TGG GGG GGA GAT ATG TGT GTT

**_k_-mers as edges**. Edges represented by 3-mers connect nodes representing the overlaps. (Fig. 4.12 from [CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/))

Because we now represent _k_-mers as edges (rather than nodes), our problem has morphed into finding a path that visits every _edge_ once, or an [Eulerian Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path):

## Euler's Theorem

Some definitions:

 * **Balanced node** - a node where the number of incoming edges is equal to the number of outgoing edges
 * **Balanced graph** - a graph where all nodes are balanced
 * **Strongly connected graph** - any node can be reached from any other node


**Euler's Theorem**:

Let's apply Euler's Theorem to a classical problem: The bridges of Königsberg problem. Here the question is: *Can you walk through all of Königsberg traversing every bridge exactly one time?* In other words: *Is there a Eulerian path through the city of Königsberg?*

(From [Campeau:2011](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n11/abs/nbt.2023.html#close))

By looking at this graph we can see that it is *unblanaced*. If one arrives to, say, the <font color="orange">orange</font> node from the <font color="blue">blue</font> node there are two ways to get out. Thus there is no way to see all of the city and traverse every bridge once!

In this case there is only one path. This because our *k* is larger that the repeat size, so we can resolve it accurately.

This is why technologies producing long sequencing reads stimulate so much enthusiasm - they will allow to resolve and produce accurate assembly of large genomes.

# Assembly in real life

In this topic we've learned about two ways of representing the relationship between reads derived from a genome we are trying to assemble:

1. **Overlap graphs** - nodes are reads, edges are overlaps between reads.
2. **DeBruijn graphs** - nodes are overlaps, edges are reads.

There are multiple reasons for such messiness:

**Sequence errors**

Sequencing machines do not give perfect data. This results in spurious deviations on the graph. Some sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore have very high error rate of ~15%.

**Ploidy**

As we discussed earlier humans are diploid and there are multiple differences between maternal and paternal genomes. This creates "bubbles" on assembly graphs:

**Repeats**

As we've seen the third law of assembly is unbeatable. As a result some regions of the genome simply cannot be resolved and are reported in segments called *contigs*:

<<<<<<< HEAD

>The following "genomic" segment will be reported in three pieces corresponding to regions flanking the repeat and repeat itself (Image from [BL](https://github.com/BenLangmead/ads1-slides/blob/master/0580_asm__practice.pdf)).

- We learned about the strategies used by assemblers for hybrid assemblies

- We performed an hybrid assembly of a bacterial genome and its annotation

- Unicycler is a pipeline bases on Spades and Pilon dedicated to hybrid assembly of Small genomes

- Combination of short and long reads helped us produce an almost perfect assembly
