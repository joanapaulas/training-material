- How do we perform a very basic genome assembly from short read data?


---

### <img class="emoji" title=":dart:" alt=":dart:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3af.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"> Objectives


- assemble some paired end reads using Velvet

# ***De novo* assembly**

]

.pull-left[

**The process of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from the fragment reads alone.**

* Instinctively like a jigsaw puzzle

  * Find reads which "fit together" (overlap)
  * Could be missing pieces (sequencing bias)
  * Some pieces will be dirty (sequencing errors)

## "Genome assembly is impossible." - A/Prof. Mihai Pop

---
.enlarge120[

# **Why is it so hard?**

]

.pull-left[
* Millions of pieces
  * Much, much shorter than the genome
  * Lots of them look similar
* Missing pieces
  * Some parts can't be sequenced easily
* Dirty Pieces
  * Lots of errors in reads
]

.pull-right[ ![](../../images/worlds_hardest.png) ]

---

# **Assembly recipe**

* Find all overlaps between reads
  * Hmm, sounds like a lot of work..
* Build a graph
  * A picture of the read connections
* Simplify the graph
  * Sequencing errors will mess it up a lot
* Traverse the graph
  * Trace a sensible path to produce a consensus

---

![](../../images/olc_pic.png)

---

# **A more realistic graph**

![](../../images/real_graph.png)

---

# .image-15[![](../../images/nofun.png)] **What ruins the graph?**

* Read errors
  * Introduces false edges and nodes

* Non haploid organisms
  * Heterozygosity causes lots of detours

* Repeats
  * If they are longer than the read length
  * Causes nodes to be shared, locality confusion.

---

# **Repeats**

---
.enlarge120[
# **What is a repeat?**
]

.pull-left[

#### ***A segment of DNA which occurs more than once in the genome sequence***

* Very common
  * Transposons (self replicating genes)
  * Satellites (repetitive adjacent patterns)
  * Gene duplications (paralogs)

# **Beyond contigs**
]

.pull-left[

Contig sizes are limited by:

* the length of the repeats in your genome
  * Can't change this


* the length (or "span") of the reads
  * Use long read technology
  * Use tricks with other technology

**We can exploit this information!**
---

.enlarge120[# **Scaffolding**]

* **Paired end reads**
  * Known sequences at each end of fragment
  * Roughly known fragment length

* **Most ends will occur in same contig**

* **Some will occur in different contigs**
  * ***evidence that these contigs are linked***

.enlarge120[# **Contigs to Scaffolds**]

![](../../images/scaffolding.png)

---

.enlarge120[# **Assessing assemblies**]

* We desire
  * Total length similar to genome size
  * Fewer, larger contigs
  * Correct contigs

* Metrics
  * No generally useful measure. (No real prior information)
  * Longest contigs, total base pairs in contigs, **N50**, ...

---

.enlarge120[# **The "N50"**]

.enlarge120[***The length of that contig from which 50% of the bases are in it and shorter contigs***]

* Imagine we have 7 contigs with lengths:
  * 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20

* Total
  * 1+1+3+5+8+12+20 = 50

* N50 is the "halfway sum" = 25
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * 1+1+3+5+8+**12** = 30 (>25) so **N50 is 12**
=======
  * 1+1+3+5+8+**12** = 30 (&gt;25) so **N50 is 12**

.enlarge120[# **2 levels of assembly**]

* Draft assembly
  * Will contain a number of non-linked scaffolds with gaps of unknown sequence
  * Fairly easy to get to

* Closed (finished) assembly
  * One sequence for each chromosome
  * Takes a **lot** more work
  * Small genomes are becoming easier with long read tech
  * Large genomes are the province of big consortia (e.g. Human Genome Consortium)

.enlarge120[# **How do I do it?**]

.enlarge120[
# **Example**

* Culture your bacterium


* Extract your genomic DNA


* Send it to your sequencing centre for Illumina sequencing
  * 250bp paired end


* Get back 2 files

  * .remark-code[MRSA_R2.fastq.gz]

* We will do a simple assembly using **Velvet** in **Galaxy**
* We can do a number of different assemblies and compare some assembly metrics.

- We assembled some Illumina fastq reads into contigs using a short read assembler called Velvet

- We showed what effect one of the key assembly parameters, the k-mer size, has on the assembly

- It looks as though there are some exploitable patterns in the metric data vs the k-mer size.
